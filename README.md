# CunaApiLogicApps
Logic apps created to satisfy the 4 API calls for the CUNA Backend Tech Lead Coding Challenge.

I decided that the most straightforward way to implement the 4 API calls would be using Azure Logic Apps, as they are very useful way to orchestrate a workflow of HTTP requests.
There is a single Logic App for each HTTP request that must be supported.  I have used Visual Studio 2019 to build the logic apps, as this allows saving incrementally to this GitHub repository.
